# Briefly summarize what you have accomplished

We have put together the formulas and equations for wormhole rendering, which is
essential for our later implementation.

# Preliminary Results 
- N/A

# Reflect on progress relative to your plan
We are a little bit behind schedule on our plan because of the decision to try
switching over to project 4. Despite this, we feel good about our understanding
of what needs to be implemented update your work plan as appropriate By the end
of this week we plan to have written the majority of our code, and have a basic
working implementation of the wormhole. Between the end of the week and the
final due date, the goal is to fine tune our implementation, test it with
different images, and observe and showcase the effect of using different
variables.  Unfortunately, because of setbacks, it’s looking like we might not
have time to implement our “hoping to deliver” dream, which entailed a
simulation of one going through the rendered wormhole. We’ve also realized this
might have been extremely difficult to create computationally, potentially
requiring a dedicated GPU.  During the testing phase after the end of the week
is also when we plan to create all final deliverables.

Below are some implementation details that we will follow: 

## The ray equations 
These five equations of the following quantities {l, θ, φ, pl, pθ} as a function
of t form the geodesic(ray), which guarantee the lateral part of each ray moves
along a great circle.
## Generating the map
- Choose a camera location (lc, θc, φc)
- Set up local Cartesian coordinates centered on the camera according to the diagrams below. 
- Set up a local spherical polar coordinate system based on A.9a.
- Choose a direction (θcs, φcs) on the camera’s local sky
- Compute the incoming light ray’s canonical momenta using A.9c, and then compute the ray’s constants of motion using A.9d.
- Put everything together.
